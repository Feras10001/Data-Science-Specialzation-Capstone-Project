Title: Comparing Three Capital Cities in Saudi Arabia 
---------------------------------------------------------
Objective: the purpose of this project is to comapre three of the largest cities in Saudi Arabia: Riyadh, Jeddah, and Dammam. 
The purpose of this comparison is to find the highest trends in each of the three cities. This will help investors and new business owners in it two ways:
1- Investing in a businiss that didn't spread wide yet but may have a high demand. For example if during the explorition it was found out that gyms are not a frequent venue,
   yet there is a demand on it, an investor can invest in that sector.
2- Fidning the most populer and highest trends in order to invest. For example if it was found out that Jeddah city has a lot of resturants, it maight be a chance for someone who
   wants to start his business to open a resturant.
---------------------------------------------------------
There were three questions I was trying to answer: what are the most popular venues categories in each city? Is there a different trend for each city? Are those popular venues, whithin each city, located nearby each other (trend based on location)? 
----------------------------------------------------------
Findings Summary: it was found that coffee shops are at the most popular venues across all three cities. Moroever, most of the popular venues are similar between the three cities.
However, the ranking of those venues in each city are mostly different. Finally, within each city it can be found that the most of the popular shops are within the same location, suggesting that the when a new venue popularity can be inluanced based on the category of this shop (coffee shop, hotel, resturant, ...etc) and the location if it is located nearby other popular places.
----------------------------------------------------------
I used the follwong libraries: Pandas, numpy, json, geopy.geocoders, requests, pandas.io.json, and folium
Finding the data would be through utilization of Four Squere API and exploring each city and finding its populer venues and trends.
There are three files in the repo: the jupyter note book, PDF report, and presentation
