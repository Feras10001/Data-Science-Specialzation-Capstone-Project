Title: Comparing Three Capital Cities in Saudi Arabia 
---------------------------------------------------------

**Project motivation:** the purpose of this project is to comapre three of the largest cities in Saudi Arabia: Riyadh, Jeddah, and Dammam to look at the most popular venues and thier categories in each of the three cities. This will help investors and new business owners in it two ways:
1. Investing in a businiss that didn't spread wide yet but may have a high demand. For example if during the explorition it was found out that gyms are not a frequent venue,
   yet there is a demand on it, an investor can invest in that sector.
2. Fidning the most populer and highest trends in order to invest. For example if it was found out that Jeddah city has a lot of resturants, it maight be a chance for someone who
   wants to start his business to open a resturant.

There were three questions to answer:
- what are the most popular venues categories in each city? 
- Is there a different trend for each city? 
- Are those popular venues, whithin each city, located nearby each other (trend based on location)?
